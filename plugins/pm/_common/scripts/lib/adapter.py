"""Adapter lookup — which file carries the calls for a tool, or that none does.

The calls for one tool live in one file, named by the type the config uses: trackers/<type>.md
for a task tracker, sources/<type>.md for chat or a calendar. The bundled ones sit under
_common/ beside this script. The ones you draft live outside the plugin — `adapters.dirs` in
the config — so an update does not overwrite them. Later dirs cover earlier, like the config
layers, so a file of yours with the same name replaces a bundled one.

Usage
    python3 adapter.py --kind trackers --type notion     → the path to read
    python3 adapter.py --kind sources  --type slack
    python3 adapter.py --kind trackers --type none       → prints "none", exit 0 — no adapter needed
    python3 adapter.py --kind trackers --type linear     → exit 3, stderr says where the template is
    python3 adapter.py --kind trackers --type github --role record
                                                          → exit 4: the file exists but answers as a mirror
    --name pm-conventions.yaml                             the config filename, as resolve-config takes it

Exit 3 is the one a skill stops on. It means the type names a tool nobody has written the calls
for. The fix is /pm:setup drafting them from the tools connected on this machine — never a
skill improvising them from what it remembers of the tool's API.

Exit 4 is the other stop. The file exists, but its `roles:` line does not include the side
the skill is reading — a mirror-only adapter asked for a record's list, say. Half an adapter
is not an adapter for the other half; 3b drafts the missing side.
