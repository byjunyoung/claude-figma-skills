"""Preflight — says whether this machine can actually run the skills, before one is run.

This file lives as a copy in each plugin. Change one and not the other and verify catches it.

The README's own troubleshooting says it plainly: a skill cannot call a tool it was never
given, and it does not fail loudly when one is missing — it simply cannot reach it. A first
run then looks like it did nothing. This runs before that happens and names what is absent.

Which plugin it is speaking for comes from its own path, so the two copies stay identical.

What counts as required is not fixed. Before a config exists nothing beyond the host rows can
be, because whether GitHub matters depends on a value nobody has written yet. Once the config
names a tracker, the connector it needs is required — and a setup skill that has just asked
which tools are in play passes them with --require, so the verdict means something on a
machine that has no config yet.

Usage
    python3 preflight.py                          → a report, exit 1 if a hard requirement is missing
    python3 preflight.py --quiet                  → only the lines that need attention, and the summary
    python3 preflight.py --require Notion,GitHub  → treat these connectors as required for this run

What it cannot see: Claude in Chrome is a browser extension, not an MCP server, so it does
not appear in `claude mcp list`. It is reported as unknown rather than guessed at. A Figma
seat is not visible from the shell either — the skills that write check it with `whoami`.
