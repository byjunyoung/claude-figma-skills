"""SessionStart — keeps a config that is shared through a repository from going quietly stale.

This file lives as a copy in each plugin. Change one and not the other and verify catches it.

A team that runs these skills against one tracker shares one config, and every machine holds
a copy of it. A copy says nothing about its own age: the run succeeds either way, and the
first sign that a machine was working from an old one is the thing it wrote. Anything that
asks the file to declare its own version fails here twice over — a file written before a key
existed cannot say anything about that key, and a person who reads the warning can silence
it by editing the stamp rather than the file.

So nothing is declared. Where the config resolves into a git work tree, that is the team
saying so structurally, and this asks git.

    CLAUDE_SHARED_CONFIG=off     do nothing
                         fetch   look, report, change no file        (default)
                         pull    fast-forward the work tree as well

The default touches no file. Pulling is somebody's decision and is turned on deliberately —
one line in settings.json, which /<plugin>:setup offers to write.

It says nothing when the copy is current. A hook that prints on every session start is
wallpaper by the third day, and the run it needed to be read on is the one it is skipped on.
Two plugins sharing one work tree do not fetch it twice: the stamp is keyed by that tree.
