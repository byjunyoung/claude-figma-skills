"""Config resolver — finds the config files, deep-merges them, emits one line of JSON.

This file lives as a copy in each plugin. Change one and not the other and verify catches it.

The Figma plugin sandbox has no filesystem. So the config is resolved on the host and the
resulting JSON is prepended to the audit script as `const CFG = {...};` before it goes to use_figma.

Usage
    python3 resolve-config.py [fileKey]      → JSON (stdout)
    python3 resolve-config.py --js [fileKey] → one `const CFG = {...};` line
    python3 resolve-config.py --where        → which files were used, nothing else
    python3 resolve-config.py --name pm-conventions.yaml   → change the filename to look for
    python3 resolve-config.py --need task.record.ref,task.link_property
                                             → exit 2 naming any of these that is null, no JSON
    python3 resolve-config.py --authored task.contract.level
                                             → exit 3 naming any of these no layer of yours sets
    python3 resolve-config.py --origin       → where this machine's config came from, nothing else

A skill that cannot run without a value asks for it with --need. A null there is a config
gap — setup writes it — and the skill stops on the key's name instead of running on nothing,
which is how a run on an unfinished config used to come back thin and look like a result.

--authored is the axis beside it, and --need cannot see what it sees. A key no config of
yours mentions still resolves — to the floor's value — so it is not missing, it is somebody
else's. Where that value decides the shape of what a run writes out, the run is deciding it
on a default the team never saw. Preflight already keeps the floor apart for the same
reason: a requirement comes from a value somebody wrote, never from a default nobody chose.

The layers merge (later covers earlier). A config holding only some keys works as it is —
missing keys are filled by the defaults, and only what is written gets covered.
    1. ../conventions.example.yaml           bundled defaults (the floor)
    2. ~/.claude/<name>                      the user's shared config
    3. ./<name>                              per project (strongest)

Deleting a key does not switch a check off — write null for that. Deleting restores the default.
A map keeps the order the schema declares; write every one of its keys to reorder it.

    share a config, not the only one. Nothing here goes near the network: the count git can
