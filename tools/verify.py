"""Repository consistency check — every plugin registered in the marketplace.

    python3 tools/verify.py      # this check alone
    bash tools/verify-all.sh     # this plus every fixture — the list CI runs

Run this after editing a skill. It is the regression gate for as long as `plugin eval` stays
behind early access. It checks one thing: has the documentation drifted from the reality —
a config key a skill references that is not in the schema, a skill it points at that does not
exist, a skill no README introduces, a section one language's README has and the other does not,
a version with no changelog entry, a team-specific value left in.

What it cannot do is read a sentence and judge whether it is still true. That half is a checklist,
in CLAUDE.md at the repository root.

This is a repository development tool, so it does not live inside a plugin. It never ships to an install.

Exit code 0 pass / 1 violations.
